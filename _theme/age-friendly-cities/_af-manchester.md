### Age Friendly Manchester

Manchester City became a member of the WHO Age Friendly Cities network in 2010, committing to improve social participation of older residents, and improve the quality of local communities for older people.  

Age-Friendly Manchester (AFM) is a partnership involving organisations, groups and individuals across the city playing their part in making Manchester a great place to grow older. Working alongside a board of older residents, a dedicated AFM team in the Council works toward influencing and educating organisations across the city and the wider public about how they can contribute to this aim (including the Council itself). This work is in line with the World Health Organisation’s concept of age-friendliness, which relates to **“policies, services and structures related to the physical social environment that are designed to support and enable older people to ‘age actively’ – that is to live in security, enjoy good health and continue to participate fully in society.”**

The AFM strategy (the ten year Manchester Ageing Strategy published in 2009) sets out the City’s plan to address these issues by developing local networks of services and promoting public health services, in conjunction with City-wide reform as set out in the ‘Our Manchester’ programme. These initiatives are key to reducing the high demands on services but the approach taken is focused on building on existing strengths to improve the quality of life of Manchester’s older population.
