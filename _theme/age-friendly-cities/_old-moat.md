### Old Moat in an Age Friendly Manchester

**In 2012, the ‘Old Moat in an Age Friendly Manchester’ project was commissioned by Southway Housing Trust (a community based housing provider and social enterprise that owns and manages half of the stock in the area) in partnership with the Manchester City Council (MCC) ‘Age Friendly Manchester’ programme (AFM).**

The ‘Old Moat in an Age Friendly Manchester’ project was undertaken by the Centre for PHASE at the Manchester School of Architecture, working with the Manchester Institute for Collaborative Research into Ageing (MICRA). It followed the research framework, conceptual principles and practical design guidance of the WHO AFCC programme, working with the local community to make the Old Moat neighbourhood more Age-friendly.

#### Manchester

In Manchester, older people form a smaller than average proportion of the population and the number of people aged 65 and over is currently decreasing, set against an above average number of young adults. This is a combination of natural losses and emigrants not being replaced by a large enough cohort of late middle-aged people and older people moving into the city. While there are some settled communities of older people, many live in areas where they are isolated or living in poverty.

With the 2011 Census showing even lower numbers of people aged 65 and over than predicted, it would seem logical to assume health and social care needs will be reduced; however, evidence shows the reverse is true. The characteristics of Manchester’s older residents mean that they are more likely to place high demands on hospital emergency and mental health services and suffer from long term limiting illnesses at an earlier stage in their old age than nationally.

However, there are specific areas and pockets with higher concentrations of older people.

#### Old Moat

Old Moat is a ward of Manchester City with around 14,000 people with about 13% of its population over 55 years- old. While this is well below the Manchester average (circa 20%), a large student / younger population, concentrated around the district centre on the eastern edge, leads to much higher percentages of older people to the west, reaching 40% in some parts. In UK terms, there are high levels of deprivation and life limiting illnesses as well as low life expectancy.

### Old Moat

**The Age Friendly Old Moat project undertook both research and design activities seeking to discover how Age-friendly the area is now and develop activities to make it more Age-friendly**

Our interdisciplinary research and design team used expertise from architecture, urban design, sociology, gerontology and community development, to consider both social and physical aspects of the neighbourhood. We engaged with the local community to explore Age-friendliness across the WHO domains in order to design interventions which would increase Age-friendliness.

A key enabling objective of our approach was to increase resident participation across a range of circumstances and improve engagement between residents and city stakeholders (e.g. transport and service providers). In an area previously without an enduring, constituted group of residents or tenants of any age, the objective was to improve both the reception of, and resident involvement in, decision-making in the neighbourhood.

The project attempted to do this through the co-creation of a neighbourhood ‘action plan’ involving both residents and institutional stakeholders in its preparation and implementation. This ‘action plan’ was a device developed to gather and reconcile explorations into the lived experience of older residents from across multiple WHO domains so that findings could be discussed and shared and developed into proposals for interventions.

Rather than a process of ‘consultation’, the co- production of this action plan enabled residents to be active in designing a programme of improvements that responded to their actual, specific experiences within the neighbourhood. A range of resident involvements instigated during the project continue at the time of writing and the Capability methodologies of the pilot are now being tested at a larger scale in the Greater Manchester ‘Ambition for Ageing’ project for which the MSA PHASE research team are contributing as ‘Local Delivery Leads’ in Manchester.
