MSA's student yearbook for 2013 leavers.

> Manchester is only one of several cities that have aspired to be called
the ‘Venice of the North’, but here such idyllic comparisons serve to
belie the fact that many thousands of people died navigating these
canals, the hand-dug trade conduits which gave birth to industrial
capitalism. Manchester from the beginning was a city that told two
dramatically polarised tales of riches and rags and ultimately brought
both Capitalism and Communism to the world. Polar inequalities remain
in both the social and physical fabric of the city, with receding industry
leaving a discontinuous urbanism and recessional politics forcing the
withdrawal of communal facilities and services.

> We explore the role of urban design and architecture in improving
conditions in socially and physically fragmented environments where
there is little by way of the continuous historical fabric of the richer
cities and towns to which we may aspire; and much less access to the
opportunities which the occupants of affluent places tend to enjoy. In
a city where we teach and learn how to make it beautiful and useful,
we acknowledge the paradox that if architecture does nothing to serve
wider society then we all, every day, suffer a poorer city.
