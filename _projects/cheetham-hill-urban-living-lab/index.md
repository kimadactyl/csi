An urban design and community engagement project exploring dimensions of spatial exclusion in North Manchester.

This study was commissioned by North Manchester Regeneration team, Agefriendly
Manchester and ZEST North Manchester Healthy Living Network. The
study explores the experience of participants in accessing the full range of facilities
in their neighbourhood with respect to their location relative to ‘Cheetham Hill
Village’.

The focus of the study is made with respect to the WHO Age-friendly City
(AFC) framework. This represents an attempt at providing an holistic view of
the relationship between the urban environment and the well-being of citizens
as they age. A key principle of the AFC guidance is that of enabling citizens to
‘actively age’, removing barriers to and enabling productive social participation to
promote physical and mental well-being, increasing both the quality and length
of life. While participants of all ages have been engaged, there has been a strong
emphasis on older people, examining the role the district centre plays in the social
and civic participation of residents of local neighbourhoods with respect to their
ability to ‘actively-age’. To specifically address these issues of well-being within
the WHO AFC framework, the research will address its research questions to
relate to a ‘5 ways to well-being’ approach, incorporating the 5 holistic aspects
of ‘well-being’ identified by the New Economics Foundation research into both
focus group questions and community audit questionnaires.
