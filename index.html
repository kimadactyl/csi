        <p class="mbm">The Centre for Spatial Inclusion works with communities to design more inclusive cities.</p>

        <p class="mbm">We believe that cities should be democratic, accessible to everyone, socially and environmentally sustainable, and <em>fun</em>. We work with excluded groups to make this vision a reality.</p>

        <p>CSI is part of the Manchester School of Architecture. We work in partnership with Manchester City Council, Manchester University, and Manchester Metropolitan University.</p>
