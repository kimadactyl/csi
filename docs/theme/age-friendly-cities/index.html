    <div class="row">
      <div class="small-12 medium-8 large-7 columns">
        <p>The key imperatives of increasingly aged and growing urban populations are often seen against a background of national and international reductions and reorganisations of state provision of health and social care services in response to banking crises and growing debt. Across the world, but specifically in the UK, these factors have led to increased expectations of the necessity of community action in social provision. While this is clearly an urgent, growing and wide-ranging societal challenge, approaches to this agenda are currently under-explored both in terms of individual disciplines and collectively between disciplines.</p>

<p>Increased valuation of the importance of community contribution and activity is predicated on the assumption that they are able to ameliorate currently intractable health and social care problems (for example by improving measurable outcomes and reducing budgetary pressure for institutional providers). However, there is currently a lack of coherent methodological and experimental explorations of these complex situations – both in terms of practically achieving these kinds of community-led holistic interventions and how we are able to account for their failures and successes.</p>

<p>The key issues arising from a locality-based community-led health and integration agenda relate both to how we achieve and account for the following issues.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The activation and development of communities.</li>
  <li>What potential this can have for health and well-being outcomes,</li>
  <li>The relationship of the above to place and environment.</li>
  <li>The relationship of the above to the production of policy and evaluation.</li>
  <li>The structure and performance of institutional actors.</li>
</ol>

<p>These issues can be framed as research questions as follows:</p>

<h3 id="how-can-health-and-well-being-provisions-be-inclusive-for-ageing-populations-and-integrated-within-communities">How can Health and Well Being provisions be inclusive for ageing populations and integrated within communities?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Health and Social care integration appears to be positively related to place based structures of working because the ‘needs’ and impacts of Health and Social care are experienced and understood in service delivery – the location of integration is the ‘patient’ or citizen.</li>
  <li>Community involvement has become a central narrative (big society etc.) but in health care terms there has been little planning for or evidencing of the affects of these kinds of systemic integration on even non-clinical hard-nosed metrics such as ‘reducing inappropriate A&amp;E appointments’ or probably even more significantly ‘reducing discharge delays’.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-can-we-develop-holistic--systemic-community-led-health-and-well-being-interventions">How can we develop holistic / systemic community-led Health and Well Being interventions?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The Manchester Age Friendly Neighbourhood project (MAFN) has established resident-led groups working across a neighbourhood with multiple stakeholders focussed on interventions reducing social Isolation</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-can-we-establish-evidence-bases-for-community-led-interventions-across-medical-social-and-holistic-evaluations">How can we establish evidence bases for community-led interventions across Medical, Social and Holistic evaluations?</h3>

<p>What is the role of the specificity of place in evidence bases, policy frames and intervention propositions?</p>

<ul>
  <li>MAFN has developed a mixed-methods research methodology with a place-specific emphasis involving a multi-disciplinary examination of place and community</li>
  <li>The MMU Centre for Spatial Inclusion is developing a conceptual framework for Age Friendly Cities and Neighbourhood research using a capability model and a theory of affect.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-is-the-role-of-individual-community-and-institutional-agency-in-evidence-bases-policy-frames-and-intervention-propositions">What is the role of individual (community and institutional) agency in evidence bases, policy frames and intervention propositions?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>MAFN is working with transformative community development techniques alongside developing a theory of change /affect research methodology as part of a multi-stakeholder partnership working at local, city, regional, national and international scales.</li>
  <li>The Old Moat Pilot project document has been cited as best practice at the UN and is available online from a range of esteemed institutional sources including the International Federation on Ageing, the UK Housing Lin.</li>
  <li>The development of shared knowledge platforms between these multiple stakeholders so they can work and plan together appears to be an essential component of research and communication</li>
  <li>Any theory of change or affect has ultimately to attempt to link systemic changes intended through community-led / place-based working to the evidentiary and economic levers of institutional providers to enable responsive and progressive reallocation of resources and resource allocation powers.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-do-these-issues-relate-to-the-wider-population-and-individual-disciplines">How do these issues relate to the wider population and individual disciplines?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>These research questions are theoretically applicable to any demographic group similarly excluded or associated with societal challenge. While all of these issues are related to Age and Ageing, the Who ‘capability’ conception of Age Friendly Cities opens these problems out across the whole life-course and by so doing strategies both research and policy avenues over time rather than only tactically focussing in a particular demography.</li>
  <li>The WHO AFC model explores a range of determinates in eight domains and the interrelation between them. As each domain addresses multiple specific disciplines the WHO integrated approach is required to address the models and evidentiary frameworks of Medical, Social and Ecological approaches.</li>
</ul>
